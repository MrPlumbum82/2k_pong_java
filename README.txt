This is the skeleton of a simple game of Pong. I want to build on top of this blueprint to create a new, fresher feeling pong game with simple features such as 4 player mode, paddle customization, map customization, etc.

To build:
	javac -d build/ -sourcepath src/ src/Frame.java

To Run:
	java -cp build/ Frame
